Born in North York, Toronto, in 1982, I’ve spent a lifetime exploring the streets and history of Toronto and its neighborhoods. Over the years, I’ve developed an intimate understanding of their transformation—from the 19th century to the vibrant, diverse communities we see today. My love for Toronto and its neighborhoods and greenspaces is rooted in their mix of charm and resilience, reflected in their architecture, greenspaces, and local stories.
